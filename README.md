I. SUMMARY:
	- This was an assignment for my Intro to Cybersecurity class. It demonstrated knowledge of command injection attacks, SQL 		injection attacks, reverse shells, and the creation of webshell clients via a read–eval–print loop (REPL) algorithm.
	- This assignment consists of two programs-- with two versions of the first one-- that perform command injection and SQL 		injection cyber attacks respectively on PentesterLab, a sample website used to introduce vulnerabilities in urls.
	- The programs take the IP address of the Pentester website, which is obtained through a virtual machine, as a command line 		argument.
	- While running, the programs act as webshells that support bash commands for the command injection files (lab3sh.py and 		lab3sh-ncat.py) and a set of custom commands for the SQL injection file (lab2sqli-2.py).
		- Running certain commands can give access to passwords, database information, etc.

II. HOW TO RUN:
	- Set up a Linux VM and use the .iso file included in this repository as the startup disk.
		- Ensure that the "Attached to" option in the Network settings is at "Host-only Adapter" otherwise the IP address you 			receive will be inaccurate
	- The VM should start once you're able to type and issue commands as you would in a terminal/ shell.
	- Type "ifconfig" to retrieve the IP address of the Pentester website. It's the "inet6 addr" under "eth0".
	- Run any of the three python files (lab3sh.py and lab3sh-ncat.py for command injection, lab3sqli-2.py for SQL injection) with 		the IP address as a command line argument.
		- NOTE: If you're running lab3sh-cat.py, edit line 45 to where the myIP variable is set to your IP address which can be 		retrieved by using the command "ipconfig" on your device.
  	- For the command injection files, input any command that you normally would in bash (e.g. whoami, pwd, ls).
	- For the SQL injection file, input any of the following commands:
		- dbs
		- tables <database>
		- columns <database> <table>
		- dump <database> <table>
	- TO EXIT:
		- For lab3sh.py and lab3sqli-2.py, type in "exit"
		- For lab3sh-ncat.py, CTRL + C
