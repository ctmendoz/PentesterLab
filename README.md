<h1>I. SUMMARY:</h1>
	<h2>- This was an assignment for my Intro to Cybersecurity class. It demonstrated knowledge of command injection attacks, SQL 		injection attacks, reverse shells, and the creation of webshell clients via a read–eval–print loop (REPL) algorithm.</h2>
	<h2>- This assignment consists of two programs-- with two versions of the first one-- that perform command injection and SQL 		injection cyber attacks respectively on PentesterLab, a sample website used to introduce vulnerabilities in urls.</h2>
	<h2>- The programs take the IP address of the Pentester website, which is obtained through a virtual machine, as a command line 	argument.</h2>
	<h2>- While running, the programs act as webshells that support bash commands for the command injection files (lab3sh.py and 		lab3sh-ncat.py) and a set of custom commands for the SQL injection file (lab2sqli-2.py).</h2>
		<h2>- Running certain commands can give access to passwords, database information, etc.</h2>

<h1>II. HOW TO RUN:</h1>
	<h2>- Set up a Linux VM and use the .iso file included in this repository as the startup disk.</h2>
		<h2>- Ensure that the "Attached to" option in the Network settings is at "Host-only Adapter" otherwise the IP address you 		receive will be inaccurate</h2>
	<h2>- The VM should start once you're able to type and issue commands as you would in a terminal/ shell.</h2>
	<h2>- Type "ifconfig" to retrieve the IP address of the Pentester website. It's the "inet6 addr" under "eth0".</h2>
	<h2>- Run any of the three python files (lab3sh.py and lab3sh-ncat.py for command injection, lab3sqli-2.py for SQL injection) with the IP address as a command line argument.</h2>
		<h2>- NOTE: If you're running lab3sh-cat.py, edit line 45 to where the myIP variable is set to your IP address which can be retrieved by using the command "ipconfig" on your device.</h2>
  	<h2>- For the command injection files, input any command that you normally would in bash (e.g. whoami, pwd, ls).</h2>
	<h2>- For the SQL injection file, input any of the following commands: </h2>
		<h2>- dbs</h2>
		<h2>- tables <database></h2>
		<h2>- columns <database> <table></h2>
		<h2>- dump <database> <table></h2>
	<h1>- TO EXIT:</h1>
		<h2>- For lab3sh.py and lab3sqli-2.py, type in "exit"</h2>
		<h2>- For lab3sh-ncat.py, CTRL + C</h2>
